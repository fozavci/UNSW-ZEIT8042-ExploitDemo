// Content

== Introduction

This repository provides a stack overflow vulnerable application and exploit demonstration. The content is prepared for ZEIT8042 - Introduction to Exploit Development course in UNSW Canberra.

The contents of the repository is listed in <<tab-layout>>.

[#tab-layout]
[cols="<20%,<80%", options="header"]
.Directory layout for submission.
|===
| Directory| Contents

| `/app`
| Source code for a vulnerable application.

| `/exploit`
| Python scripts to demonstrate exploitation of the application.

|===

Tasks:

. Perform a `git clone` of the repository.

. Replace the contents with your vulnerable application, and retain the folder structure as per <<tab-layout>>.

. Write a https://makefiletutorial.com/[Makefile], which will be used to compile your vulnerable application.

. Provide instructions on how to build, execute, and exploit the application in <<sec-application>> and <<sec-exploit>>.

. Indicate in your submission the operating system and CPU architecture where your application should be built, and is vulnerable.

Restrictions:

* Your vulnerable application should compile and execute within an x86 or AMD64/Intel64 virtual machine. It is recommended you target either the https://kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines[Kali Linux] 2021.2 or Windows 7 Professional (SP1) operating system.

* Alternatively, if targeting another operating system. Include a https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile[Vagrantfile] and provisioning scripts to build the virtual machine.

* Use https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor], or https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/[Markdown], to document your submission.

Tips:

* If not familiar with https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] the document editor https://asciidocfx.com/[AsciidocFX] can help ensure the formatting of the document is valid.

* For https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/[Markdown], the visual editor https://typora.io[typora] provides a similar capability.

* Windows 7 Professional (SP1) ISO images are available to download for a {url-win-7-x86}[32-bit] or {url-win-7-x64}[64-bit] CPU architecture. The SHA1 hash values of these ISO images have been verified against values posted {url-win-7-sha1-values}[here].
